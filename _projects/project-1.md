## Description
We develop a three-level algorithm called PBS-SIPP-Linear Programming (PSL) to solve the intersection coordination problem. Theoretically, PSL is complete and polynomial-time in the number of vehicles. Empirically, PSL runs significantly faster with only a slight compromise in the solution quality than the optimal MILP method. It also generates significantly better solutions with a slightly larger runtime than the traditional First-Come-First-Served strategy.
