## Description
I developed the software for IoT Gateway for Smart Street Lighting project. The Gateway communicates with IoT devices via Zigbee commnunication, and exchanges data with the server via MQTT. Basically, Gateway is able to receive commands from server to control IoT devices and transmit log data from IoT devices to the server.

There are two versions of the software:
* IoT Gateway software for Linux-based OS (i.e. Raspberry Pi)
* IoT Gateway software for Digi Industrial Gateway
## Tech Stack
* Python
* MQTT
* Zigbee
